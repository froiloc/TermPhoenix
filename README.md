# TermPhoenix üî•

*An intelligent web crawler that extracts special-interest terminology from websites*

TermPhoenix rises from the ashes of unstructured web content to uncover the hidden terminology that defines special interests, fandoms, and niche communities. Like a phoenix, it rebirths raw text into organized, scored term lists.

## üöÄ Features

- **Smart Crawling**: Configurable depth, rate limiting, and domain control
- **Advanced Scoring**: Emphasis detection, capitalization weighting, cross-page significance
- **N-gram Detection**: Multi-word phrase extraction with intelligent stop-word handling
- **Quantile Normalization**: 0-100 scoring with outlier management
- **SQLite Cache**: Resume interrupted crawls and re-analyze with different parameters

## üìã Planned Parameters

### Crawling Behavior
- `--url`: Starting URL(s)
- `--depth`: Crawl depth (0 = single page)
- `--allow-leave-domain`: Permit cross-domain crawling
- `--ignore-robots-txt`: Bypass robots.txt restrictions
- `--threads`: Parallel request count (0-16)
- `--scan-behavior`: Rate limiting profile (0-5)

### Analysis Parameters
- `--threshold-word`: Minimum score for single words (0-100)
- `--threshold-n-grams`: Minimum score for phrases (0-100)
- `--language`: Primary language (de/en)
- `--update-cache`: Force recrawl ignoring cache

### Output Control
- `--output-format`: JSON, CSV, Excel
- `--min-frequency`: Absolute frequency cutoff
- `--include-common-words`: Keep stop words in results
